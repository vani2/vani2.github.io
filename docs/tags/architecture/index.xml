&lt;p&gt;Here at Redmadrobot, we try to deal with serious businesses and long-term projects. So many of our clients work with us for years while we as developers improve functionality by new features. We need to refactor our code base from time to time, support new iOS versions to be on the edge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Finding ideal architecture</title>

&lt;p&gt;For 9 years since Redmadrobot was founded, year by year, day by day there were more features in our applications. That’s become easier to get confused with. When engineers became more than a dozen, there was another problem — how quickly swap people between projects. Outsource development has strict deadlines, and engineers have no months or weeks to dive into specifics of a new project, whilst it’s unnecessary to let people work on several projects through their career because they don’t get bored and develop new skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
