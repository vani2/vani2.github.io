<blockquote>
<p>Signing your apps can be complicated. And we understand this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Code signing becomes automatic since 2017 and Xcode 8 release. It’s 3 years ago. Before that was not the easy thing to manage certificate, provisioning profiles dances for many iOS engineers. I’ve eaten dog not once on it while working in a big team and someone can accidentally <strong>revoke</strong> your certificate. I blame Apple for this for years.</p>&hellip;

<p>Here at Redmadrobot, we try to deal with serious businesses and long-term projects. So many of our clients work with us for years while we as developers improve functionality by new features. We need to refactor our code base from time to time, support new iOS versions to be on the edge.</p>&hellip;

<p>In one of our mobile apps client wants to upload a big size file to a server. The main requirement was to resume upload after connection lost. Also if a connection is poor, it can be interrupted by timeout.</p>&hellip;

<p>For 9 years since Redmadrobot was founded, year by year, day by day there were more features in our applications. That’s become easier to get confused with. When engineers became more than a dozen, there was another problem — how quickly swap people between projects. Outsource development has strict deadlines, and engineers have no months or weeks to dive into specifics of a new project, whilst it’s unnecessary to let people work on several projects through their career because they don’t get bored and develop new skills.</p>&hellip;

<p>In one of our apps, I should do something called “hidden photos”. I’ll explain it. This is not spying for our users for sure. This feature was implemented for an enterprise application, users as employees use a camera in the main process of their job. So our client wants to be sure they don’t trick and make real photos of real objects. The real scenario is to make hidden photos every 10 seconds.</p>&hellip;

<p>Next, you will read my thoughts about public talks as an engineer.
Many of us like to visit conferences. The luckiest ones were at WWDC, F8, or Google I/O. It’s great to learn something new: about apps, architecture, motivation, and so on.</p>&hellip;

<p>As a software engineer I like to coach less experienced colleagues and interns. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Our company has internships for 2 years and I actively participated in it.</p>&hellip;
